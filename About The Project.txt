✨Problem Statement:

A mobile app that crowd sources water-related problems from around a community, open sources data, etc. and display them on a map.

✨Solution/Idea:

1. Automated Data Collection: Utilize Instagram and Twitter APIs to collect data through hashtags, implementing automated data ingestion for efficiency.

2. Image Processing and Classification: Employ computer vision algorithms to process user-uploaded images. Classify issues into distinct water problem categories such as "flooding events," "water quality issues in ponds/lakes," "urban flooding," and "drainage problems."

3. Severity Assessment: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze captions and comments, while employing machine learning models for image analysis to assess the severity of identified issues.

4. Ticket Generation: Generate tickets for each detected problem, akin to project management tools. Assign statuses like "created," "live," "ongoing," and "closed" for systematic tracking.

5. Real-Time Tracking: Provide administrators with real-time access to track the status of water tickets, leveraging responsive dashboards for efficient decision-making.

6. Scalability: Architect the system with scalability in mind, enabling it to handle growing data volumes and adapt to future requirements, including financial loss estimation.

7. Financial Loss Estimation: Utilize machine learning algorithms and image-based data to estimate financial losses associated with water-related issues, enhancing the app's utility for administrators in assessing the impact of problems.

✨Tech Stack

Front-End:
1. Figma: UI/UX design.
2. Android Studio: Android app development.

Back-End:
1. Java: Server-side logic.
2. Firebase: Authentication, real-time DB.
3. PyCharm: Python scripting.
4. Google Maps API: Geolocation and mapping.
5. Postman: API testing.
6. Opengate: Social media data integration.

Modeling/ML:
1. TensorFlow/Keras: ML model development.
2. Python/Colab: Scripting and cloud-based ML development.
3. CNN: Image analysis.

✨Use Case
1. User report flooding and other water-related problems in real-time.
2. ML Model estimates the flood intensity with the generated captions.
3. Early warning can be issued by the authorities.
4. Clogged drains are photographed.
5. Communities engage and raise awareness.
6. People can donate funds to the danger-zone areas.
7. The photos uploaded by a customer in social media are also considered by the model automatically. 
8. Emergency responders and authorities can quickly identify and prioritize the areas that require immediate authentication.

✨Dependencies and Showstoppers

Dependencies:

1. Device Compatibility: Ensure the app works on various devices and operating systems for wider accessibility.
2. Data Security: Prioritize user trust and regulatory compliance by maintaining data privacy and security.
3. API Reliability: Dependence on external services like Google Maps and social media APIs requires consistent availability.

Show Stoppers:

1. Data Quality: Inaccurate user-generated data can undermine the app's reliability.
2. Adoption Challenge: Low user adoption rates may result in insufficient data for effective problem-solving.
3. Server Reliability: Unexpected server downtime can disrupt data handling and real-time communication.
4. User Awareness: Lack of citizen awareness may hinder the app's potential for crowd-sourcing issues.
